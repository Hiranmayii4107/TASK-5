I firstly installed wireshark from the web. Entered the filter "WIFI" and started capturing packets. 
Stopped the capture about 60 seconds after start of capture.
Enter specific filters and took screenshots
First 'http' for HTTP traffic.
There was no readings for https.

Found a few readings (7 to be precise)


Next, 'tcp' — for TCP packets.
Found a 27 readings for TCP packets.
